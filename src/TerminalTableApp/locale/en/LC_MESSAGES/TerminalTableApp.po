#~ "The equipment code for the terminal strip must begin with\n"

#~ "The terminals are sorted in ascending order, with numbers\n"
#~ "before letters.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "The pages are added to the project with the title Terminal diagram + slide name\n"
#~ ". Slide name K1, K2,...\n"
#~ "In terms of function, the terminal diagrams are individual elements\n"
#~ "that are also displayed in the component collection under \n"
#~ "Imported elements/Terminal diagrams.\n"
#~ "In addition, accessories are created here under /Accessories,\n"
#~ "which can be subsequently placed over the terminal diagram.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The following requirements must be met for the terminals drawn in the project\n"
#~ ":\n"
#~ "- The terminals for terminal points\n"
#~ "  must be given a name (a, b...)\n"
#~ "- The terminals for terminal points\n"
#~ "  must be declared as internal or external.\n"
#~ "- Bridges must be declared as generic.\n"
#~ "  and have no name.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "A bridge is recognised as such if the conductor in the text field is declared as ‘bridge e1’.\n"
#~ "  ‘e1’ stands for external 1, ‘i1’ for internal 1.\n"
#~ "The following bridges can be specified: e1, e2, e3, and i3, i2, i1.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Be careful when drawing terminal elements yourself.\n"
#~ "If the elements are copied or saved under a new name,\n"
#~ "the ‘uuid’ of the terminals will not be reassigned. This can\n"
#~ "lead to unexpected behaviour. Therefore, always delete the terminals\n"
#~ "and insert them again.\n"
#~ "The same applies to other elements.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Cables are queried from the XML file. However, they cannot\n"
#~ "currently be specified in Qelectrotech.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is possible to add further elements, such as an image of the\n"
#~ "terminals used or comments."
